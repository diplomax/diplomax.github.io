    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/exam_time2.png" title="&ldquo;Exam Time&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Here are the “Last Five” of the Top Ten Test Writing Tips that may help you to write a stronger exam!</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Start with a question for which you know the answer</em>.  You do not have to start at the beginning of the test.  Knowing the answer to the first question you try builds your confidence and sets a positive tone for the rest of the exam.</li>
<li><em>Look for clues and information in one part of the test that helps you to answer questions in another part</em>.  Useful information is often included in diagrams, charts, graphs, photos, and source information such as the year a photo was taken or where the author lived.  Pictures, charts, graphs, and diagrams may provide a context for the question you are expected to answer.</li>
<li><em>Answer every question even if you have to guess</em>.  Leaving a question blank is guaranteed to earn you zero marks.  An educated guess in a multiple choice question gives you an opportunity to ‘luck out’.</li>
<li><em>Read over all of your answers before you hand in your test</em>.  You want to be sure you’ve answered all the questions, that your response satisfies what was asked, and that your calculations are accurate.  Where necessary include the units of measurement.</li>
<li>  <em>Finish your answers to written response or essay questions in point form if you are running out of time</em>.  This shows the marker that you have understood the question and have an organized and thoughtful response – just not enough time for complete sentences.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="right" src="/images/exam_time.jpg" title="&ldquo;Exam Time&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>When writing an exam, there is no substitute for knowing your course material really well but you can bolster your performance by staying in the exam room for the entire amount of time and reviewing your answers.  Take a short ‘mental break’ by rolling your head from side to side and/or shrugging your shoulders.  In thinking about the overall test or reviewing specific questions, you may remember additional information to add to some of your written responses or help you with the multiple choice questions.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/test-writing-part1.jpg" title="&ldquo;Test writing tips&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>There are two components to doing well on an exam.<br/>
   <strong>One</strong> – you need to know your material. <br/> <strong>Two</strong> – you need to know <em>how</em> to write the test.  Knowing how to write the test gives you the best opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the course content.</p>

<p>Here are tips that may help you write a better exam.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Start your exam by taking a few deep breaths to calm yourself</em>.  If you are feeling anxious, use positive self-talk such as, ‘I can do this’, ‘I’m ready for this’, or ‘This is going to be my best test result’.</li>
<li><em>Immediately write down any information that you do not want to forget</em>.  For example, on a math exam, write down the formulas you may need to know and use for the exam before you begin to look at the exam instructions and questions.</li>
<li><em>Look over the entire test paper or booklet to see what type(s) of and how many questions there are in total</em>.  This gives you an overview of the specific content and concepts that are being assessed, the value or number of marks for each question, and the question format(s) to which you need to respond.</li>
<li><em>Budget your time for each section of the exam before you begin answering any part of the test</em>.  You do not want to spend a lot of time on a portion of the exam that is worth only a small percentage of the total number of marks.</li>
<li><em>Read all of the instructions carefully before you begin answering any questions</em>.  It is important that you know what you are expected to do and what specifically is required in your response.</li>
</ul>
