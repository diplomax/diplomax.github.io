<p>There are many strategies to help you maximize your performance on quizzes, unit tests, and final exams.  The following provides information on three common strategies that you may find useful.</p>

<h2>Five-Pass Strategy</h2>

<p>This strategy has five steps or ‘passes’ for answering exam questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Browsing Pass</em> – scan the entire exam; note question formats, marks for each section, instructions</li>
<li><em>First Answering Pass</em> – answer questions you know the answer to and can complete quickly; maintain a brisk pace</li>
<li><em>Second Answering Pass</em> – answer questions left during the first pass that require more effort per mark; work the questions through until you experience an impasse or it is taking too long; maintain a steady pace</li>
<li><em>Third Answering Pass</em> – complete all partial answers; guess at any true/false and multiple choice questions you have left and attempt any questions still unanswered; all questions should now have full or partial answers</li>
<li><em>Review Pass</em> – check all answers and calculations as time permits</li>
</ol>


<h2>Three-Pass Strategy</h2>

<p>This strategy has three steps or ‘passes’ for answering exam questions; is an abbreviated version of the five pass method:

<ol>
<li><em>Overview</em> – scan the entire exam; note question formats, marks for each section, instructions, and questions you can complete easily and quickly</li>
<li><em>Second Pass</em> – answer all questions you can complete without too much difficulty stopping when the question becomes too challenging or is taking too much time</li>
<li><em>Last Pass</em> – answer any questions that are left; guess and provide partial answers if necessary</li>
</ol>


<h2>Problem-Solving Strategy</h2>

<p>This strategy has four steps to work through in answering a problem; the problem can be a word problem or a calculation problem:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/strategies1.jpg" title="&ldquo;Strategies&rdquo;" ></p>

<ol>
<li><em>Understand the problem</em> – What is the question?  Do I have the information I need?</li>
<li><em>Develop a Plan</em> – Have I done something similar before?  Can I break the question down into smaller parts?</li>
<li><em>Carry out the Plan</em> – Is my process logical?  Have I shown all of the steps in the process?  Have I included the correct units of measurement?</li>
<li><em>Look Back</em> – Have I answered the question?  Does my answer make sense?</li>
</ol>


<p>When writing an exam it is important that you use strategies that work for you – strategies that you understand and can use confidently.  An exam is not the time to “try something new”.</p>
