<p>Feeling somewhat anxious or <strong>stressed</strong> before an exam is quite normal for most students.  At times the tension helps you to <strong>rise to the challenge</strong>.  Do you feel some or all of the following prior to writing a test?</p>

<ul>
<li>Nervousness/Nausea</li>
<li>Difficulty sleeping the night before</li>
<li><strong>Butterflies</strong> in your stomach</li>
<li><strong>Blanking</strong> or <strong>not being able to remember anything</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>These are common symptoms associated with test-writing anxiety that you can learn to manage effectively.  Try some of the following strategies to calm yourself and help you to focus during exam time.</p>

<h2>Before the Exam:</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/stressed.jpg" title="&ldquo;Stressed&rdquo;" ></p>

<ul>
<li>Accept that feeling anxious prior to a test is a normal feeling.</li>
<li>Associate with positive, focused classmates.</li>
<li>Take some time to relax before you go to bed the night before your test.</li>
<li>Arrive slightly before the exam prepared with the necessary pens, pencils, calculators or reference materials (if they are allowed).</li>
<li>Visualize your successful completion of the test.</li>
<li>Use positive self-talk such as <em>I can do this</em>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>During the Exam</h2>

<ul>
<li>Write anything you know or want to remember on the back of your exam such as formulas, steps in a process, or dates in a timeline.  It serves as a reminder that you do know something.</li>
<li>Begin with a question to which you know the answer to build your self-confidence.</li>
<li>Tense and relax muscles where you feel tension.  For example, raise/lower/ roll your shoulders, roll your head from side to side, or flex your fingers.</li>
<li>Concentrate on an object or spot in the room for a short period of time.</li>
<li>Focus on your breathing, slowly inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.</li>
<li>Use positive self-talk such as <em>I am doing a good job</em>; <em>When I work/read carefully I can figure this out</em>, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>Writing an exam is a stressful situation.  There is no substitution for knowing your course material but you can do your best to remain calm, positive, and focused.  When you feel in control, you will do a better job of demonstrating your understanding of the course content.</p>

<p>There are many strategies to help you maximize your performance on quizzes, unit tests, and final exams.  The following provides information on three common strategies that you may find useful.</p>

<h2>Five-Pass Strategy</h2>

<p>This strategy has five steps or ‘passes’ for answering exam questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Browsing Pass</em> – scan the entire exam; note question formats, marks for each section, instructions</li>
<li><em>First Answering Pass</em> – answer questions you know the answer to and can complete quickly; maintain a brisk pace</li>
<li><em>Second Answering Pass</em> – answer questions left during the first pass that require more effort per mark; work the questions through until you experience an impasse or it is taking too long; maintain a steady pace</li>
<li><em>Third Answering Pass</em> – complete all partial answers; guess at any true/false and multiple choice questions you have left and attempt any questions still unanswered; all questions should now have full or partial answers</li>
<li><em>Review Pass</em> – check all answers and calculations as time permits</li>
</ol>


<h2>Three-Pass Strategy</h2>

<p>This strategy has three steps or ‘passes’ for answering exam questions; is an abbreviated version of the five pass method:
<img class="right" src="/images/strategies0.png" title="&ldquo;Strategies&rdquo;" ></p>

<ol>
<li><em>Overview</em> – scan the entire exam; note question formats, marks for each section, instructions, and questions you can complete easily and quickly</li>
<li><em>Second Pass</em> – answer all questions you can complete without too much difficulty stopping when the question becomes too challenging or is taking too much time</li>
<li><em>Last Pass</em> – answer any questions that are left; guess and provide partial answers if necessary</li>
</ol>


<h2>Problem-Solving Strategy</h2>

<p>This strategy has four steps to work through in answering a problem; the problem can be a word problem or a calculation problem:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/strategies1.jpg" title="&ldquo;Strategies&rdquo;" ></p>

<ol>
<li><em>Understand the problem</em> – What is the question?  Do I have the information I need?</li>
<li><em>Develop a Plan</em> – Have I done something similar before?  Can I break the question down into smaller parts?</li>
<li><em>Carry out the Plan</em> – Is my process logical?  Have I shown all of the steps in the process?  Have I included the correct units of measurement?</li>
<li><em>Look Back</em> – Have I answered the question?  Does my answer make sense?</li>
</ol>


<p>When writing an exam it is important that you use strategies that work for you – strategies that you understand and can use confidently.  An exam is not the time to “try something new”.</p>
