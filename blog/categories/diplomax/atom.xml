<p>Alberta Education’s announcement that the weighting of your diploma mark will change from 50% to 30% was good news BUT the change does not take effect until the beginning of the 2015-16 school year.  For this June, your diploma exam mark is STILL 50% of your final grade. While teachers are doing their best to finish teaching the curriculum and provide you with a course review, the time to do all this is quickly ticking away!</p>

<p>What are you doing at home to prepare for the diploma exams? Are you using your long-term study schedule?  How about the short-term plan – or – are you counting on pulling the “all-nighter” to give you the grades you need to get into that quota faculty?  As the end of your high school career comes to a close, you need to keep as many options open as possible.  And, most of those options hinge on the final grades you get on the diploma exams and your school awarded marks.</p>

<p>If you are serious about your future, why not enroll in a weekend review class? It can give you the boost you need in your final grade to qualify for a scholarship or secure an entry level position in a career path that appeals to you.  Your teachers are doing their part.  Are you doing your part?  It’s your future – it’s up to you!</p>
